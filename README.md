# forest_maze

- forest_maze is an automatically generated maze.

## Rule

1. Starting point is 🏝️ and goal point is 🏕️.
1. You control character to move from starting point to goal point as quickly as possible. 
    - Characters operated by the user are not displayed yet and cannot be moved
    - I plan to implement time measurement.
